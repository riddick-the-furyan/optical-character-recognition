The cause of this is Gorgias. For he came\\nto the city and made the foremost of the Aleuadae lovers of his wisdom,\\n\\namong them your lover” Aristippus, as well as the other Thessalians. And he\\naccustomed you to the habit Cc of answering any question asked of you\\n\\nfearlessly and magnificently, exactly like those who know; just as he himself\\nstands ready for any question a Greek wishes to ask, and never fails to\\n\\nanswer. But in this region, dear Meno, the opposite has come to pass. There\\n\\n' Exeis moi epein means literally ‘Do you have it to tell me?” There is some reason to think that Plato\\nplayed with the conventions of the epic tradition, in which the first word set the theme for the entire poem.\\nHere, this would suggest that the question of whether knowledge is a kind of ‘having’ or possession is\\ncentral to the Meno. The question certainly comes up in Plato’s other dialogue that explicitly concerns\\nknowledge. See Theaetetus xxxx in the stranger’s debunking of the model of seeking knowledge as hunting\\nbirds in a bird cage. Certainly there the question is what it means to ‘have’ knowledge. The phrase could\\nalso mean something like “Tell me, if you have it in you...” That is, it could have a challenging tone. See\\nKlein pg. 40\\n\\n? Notice here the connection between Larissa and lovers. This theme will be revisited later in the dialogue\\nas a clue to the nature of knowledge.\\n\\x0c\""
